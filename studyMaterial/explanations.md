# Explanations

Methods in UserDAO work without realisation, because this class extends JpaRepository, which provides basic CRUD operations for working with database. There is no implementation of the findByEmail method in this code. This means that the implementation of this method will be automatically generated by Spring Data JPA based on the method name and signature. Spring Data JPA uses method naming convention to automatically generate queries. In this case, Spring Data JPA will search the database for the email field in the User entity and return the corresponding user. In my code, I'm using @NamedQuery in User.java to explicitly match the findbyEmail method.
